METHOD:  A java method is a collection of statements which are grouped together
Eg: 
public class Joy{
public static void displayName() {
System.out.println("My name is Nikita")
}
public static void main(string[] param){
displayName();
}
}



PARAMETER: They act as a variables inside the method and they are inside the parentheses
Eg: the method that takes a String called fname as parameter
public static void main(String[] fname)


ARGUMEBT: Whenever any method is called during the execution of the program there are some values passed that values are called argument.
Eg:

RETURN TYPE: the return type defines and constrains the data type of the value returned from a method.
eg: 
public class demo{
public static void double Value(double a, double b){
	double sum=0/2.0;
	sum=(a+b);
	return sum;
}
public static void  main(String[] args0{
	system.out.println("new A(). Values(5.5, 6.5)");
}
